Click **Settings** gear icon ⚙️\n2. You'll be prompted for your **Admin Password**\n3. Select the **Security** tab\n\n## Admin Password\n\n**Purpose:**\n- Protects access to Settings dialog\n- Required for any configuration changes\n- Set during first-run wizard\n\n**Changing your password:**\n1. Click **Change Admin Password** button\n2. Enter current password\n3. Enter new password\n4. Confirm new password\n5. Password updated immediately\n\n**Password requirements:**\n- Minimum 8 characters\n- No specific complexity requirements\n- Use a strong, memorable password\n\n**Last changed indicator:**\n- Shows when password was last changed\n- Helps track security hygiene\n\n## Projector Credentials Security\n\n**Encryption method:**\n- All projector passwords encrypted using **Windows DPAPI** (Data Protection API)\n- Industry-standard encryption built into Windows\n- Keys tied to your Windows user account\n\n**Entropy file (`.projector_entropy`):**\n- Critical security file\n- Required to decrypt projector passwords\n- **Must be backed up!**\n- Located in `%APPDATA%\\ProjectorControl\\`\n\n**⚠ Critical Warning:**\nIf you lose the entropy file and need to reinstall Windows or move to a new computer, you **will lose all saved projector passwords**. They cannot be recovered without this file.\n\n**Backup procedure:**\n1. Navigate to `%APPDATA%\\ProjectorControl\\`\n2. Copy `.projector_entropy` file to secure backup location\n3. Store backup on external drive or encrypted cloud storage\n4. Do NOT store in the same location as database backups\n\n## Backup Encryption\n\n**Encryption Strength:**\n- **AES-256-GCM** (Recommended) - Strongest security, slightly slower\n- **AES-128-GCM** - Fast, still very secure\n\n**Require password for backup restore:**\n- ☑ Password protect all backup files\n- Must enter password when restoring\n- Prevents unauthorized access to backups\n- Recommended: Keep enabled\n\n## Session Security\n\n**Automatically lock after inactivity:**\n- ☐ Lock settings after specified idle time\n- Default: 30 minutes\n- Protects settings if you walk away from computer\n- Requires admin password to unlock\n\n**When to enable:**\n- Shared computer environments\n- Public workstations\n- Multi-user systems\n\n**When to disable:**\n- Personal, private computer\n- No physical security concerns\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Change default password immediately**\n   - Set during first-run, but change periodically\n   - Every 90 days recommended\n\n2. **Backup entropy file**\n   - Before Windows upgrades\n   - Before hardware changes\n   - Store off-system\n\n3. **Use strong admin password**\n   - Not same as Windows login\n   - Not same as projector passwords\n   - Memorable but secure\n\n4. **Enable backup password protection**\n   - Prevents backup file theft\n   - Adds extra security layer\n\n5. **Enable session lock for shared computers**\n   - Prevents unauthorized access\n   - Minimal inconvenience for security gain\n\n> **Warning:** The entropy file is CRITICAL! If you lose it and need to reinstall Windows or move to a new computer, you will lose all saved projector passwords. See Backup and Disaster Recovery documentation for backup procedures.",
