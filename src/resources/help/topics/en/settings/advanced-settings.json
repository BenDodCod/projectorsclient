Most users should leave these at default values.\n\n## Accessing Advanced Settings\n\n1. Click **Settings** gear icon ⚙️\n2. Select the **Advanced** tab\n\n## Database Mode\n\n**Current Mode Display:**\n- Shows **Standalone (SQLite)** or **Enterprise (SQL Server)**\n- Read-only field (grayed out)\n- Cannot be changed after initial setup\n\n**Why can't I change it?**\n- Database structure differs between modes\n- Changing modes requires data migration\n- Risk of data loss if done incorrectly\n\n**Need to migrate?**\n- Contact your IT administrator\n- Follow migration procedures in deployment guide\n- Backup all data before migrating\n\n## Performance Options\n\n**Enable connection pooling**\n- ☑ Recommended: Keep enabled\n- Reuses network connections for better performance\n- Reduces connection overhead\n- Faster command execution\n\n**When to disable:**\n- Only if experiencing connection issues\n- Some firewalls may interfere\n- Usually safe to keep enabled\n\n**Cache projector status**\n- ☑ Recommended: Keep enabled\n- Reduces network traffic\n- Shows last-known status when offline\n- Refreshes every 5 seconds (configurable in Connection settings)\n\n**When to disable:**\n- If you need real-time status always\n- If status seems \"stuck\" or outdated\n- Troubleshooting connection issues\n\n## Logging Settings\n\n**Log Level options:**\n\n**Debug**\n- Maximum detail\n- Every operation logged\n- Very large log files (MB per day)\n- Only use when troubleshooting\n\n**Info** (Recommended)\n- Normal operational logs\n- Key events logged\n- Moderate file size\n- Good balance of detail vs. size\n\n**Warning**\n- Only warnings and errors\n- Minimal logging\n- Small log files\n- May miss useful troubleshooting info\n\n**Error**\n- Only errors logged\n- Very minimal logging\n- Smallest log files\n- Not recommended for normal use\n\n**Open Log Folder button:**\n- Opens `%APPDATA%\\ProjectorControl\\logs\\`\n- View log files for troubleshooting\n- Share logs with IT support\n- Each log file named with date: `projector_control_2026-02-13.log`\n\n## Developer Options\n\n**Enable debug mode**\n- ☐ Default: Disabled\n- Extra diagnostic information\n- Very large log files (10x normal size)\n- Performance impact\n\n**When to enable:**\n- Only when requested by support\n- When debugging specific issues\n- When developing custom integrations\n\n**When to disable:**\n- Normal daily use\n- After troubleshooting complete\n- If logs fill disk space\n\n**⚠ Warning:**\nDebug mode generates very large log files that can quickly consume disk space. Only enable when actively troubleshooting, and disable when done.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Leave performance options enabled**\n   - Connection pooling improves speed\n   - Status caching reduces network load\n   - Only disable if troubleshooting\n\n2. **Use Info log level normally**\n   - Good balance of detail\n   - Manageable file sizes\n   - Switch to Debug only when needed\n\n3. **Enable Debug temporarily**\n   - When experiencing issues\n   - Reproduce the problem with Debug enabled\n   - Send logs to support\n   - Switch back to Info when done\n\n4. **Clean old log files**\n   - Open log folder periodically\n   - Delete logs older than 30 days\n   - Keep recent logs for reference\n\n> **Tip:** If experiencing issues, set Log Level to \"Debug\", reproduce the problem, then send the log files to your IT administrator or support.",
