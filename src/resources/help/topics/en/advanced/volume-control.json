  "content": "## What is Volume Control?\n\nIf your projector supports network-based audio control, you can adjust volume and mute audio directly from the application.\n\n**Availability:**\n- Must be enabled in **Settings > UI Buttons**\n- Only works with projectors that support PJLink audio commands\n- Not all projector models support this feature\n\n## Adjusting Volume\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Locate the **Volume** slider in the control section\n2. Drag the slider left (quieter) or right (louder)\n3. The projector volume adjusts in real-time\n4. Current volume percentage shown below slider\n\n**Volume Range:**\n- 0% - Completely silent (same as mute)\n- 50% - Medium volume\n- 100% - Maximum volume\n\n## Muting Audio\n\n**Quick mute:**\n1. Click the **Mute** checkbox (or speaker-X icon)\n2. Audio mutes immediately\n3. Volume slider remains at previous position\n4. Uncheck to restore audio at previous volume\n\n**Mute vs. Volume 0:**\n- **Mute** - Temporary silence, one-click restore\n- **Volume 0** - Silent, must drag slider back up\n\n## Compatibility\n\n**Supported projectors:**\n- Most modern network-enabled projectors\n- PJLink Class 2 projectors\n- Manufacturer-specific models with audio pass-through\n\n**Unsupported:**\n- Older PJLink Class 1 projectors\n- Projectors without built-in speakers\n- Projectors with audio-only via analog cables\n\n**If volume control is disabled (grayed out):**\n- Your projector does not support network audio control\n- Use the projector's remote control for volume\n- Check projector manual for audio capabilities\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Volume commands fail:**\n- Projector may not support audio via network\n- Check if physical buttons on projector work\n- Some projectors require audio to be enabled in settings menu\n\n> **Note:** Not all projector models support volume control via network. If the slider is disabled (grayed out), your projector does not support this feature.",
