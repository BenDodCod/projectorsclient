  "content": "## Symptom\n\nApplication is running (visible in taskbar or system tray), but the main window is not visible on screen.\n\n**Common scenarios:**\n- Window completely invisible\n- Window partially visible (edge off-screen)\n- Window shows on second monitor that's now disconnected\n- Title bar off-screen, cannot move window\n\n## Common Causes\n\n**Monitor configuration changes:**\n- Disconnected external monitor (window was on that monitor)\n- Changed from docking station to laptop screen\n- Changed from dual monitor to single monitor\n- Swapped primary/secondary monitor\n\n**Display settings changes:**\n- Changed screen resolution\n- Changed DPI scaling\n- Rotated display orientation\n\n**Window position saved incorrectly:**\n- Application crashed while window off-screen\n- Manually dragged window off-screen\n- Multi-monitor setup changed\n\n## Quick Fix: Reset Window Position\n\n**Method 1: Using Settings (Easiest)**\n\n1. Right-click system tray icon 📽️\n2. Select **Settings**\n3. Enter admin password\n4. Go to **Diagnostics** tab\n5. Click **Reset Window Position**\n6. Window will appear centered on primary monitor\n\n**Method 2: Using Keyboard (If can't access Settings)**\n\n1. Click application icon in taskbar to select it\n2. Press `Alt+Space` (opens window menu)\n3. Press `M` (Move command)\n4. Press any arrow key (Left, Right, Up, or Down)\n5. Move mouse (window will follow cursor)\n6. Click when window is in desired position\n7. OR press `Enter` to place window at current position\n\n**Method 3: Maximize Window**\n\n1. Click application icon in taskbar\n2. Press `Windows+Up Arrow` (maximize window)\n3. Window will maximize on current monitor\n4. Press `Windows+Down Arrow` to restore (now visible)\n\n## Manual Window Positioning\n\n**If window is partially visible:**\n\n1. Click and drag the visible portion\n2. Move window to center of screen\n3. If title bar is off-screen:\n   - Use `Alt+Space` then `M` method (see above)\n   - OR maximize then restore\n\n## Preventing Future Issues\n\n**Best practices for laptop users:**\n\n1. **Before disconnecting external monitor:**\n   - Drag window to laptop screen\n   - Close window while on laptop screen\n   - OR minimize to system tray\n\n2. **Configure for laptop screen:**\n   - When using laptop screen only\n   - Resize window to fit laptop screen\n   - Position in comfortable location\n   - This position will be saved\n\n3. **Use system tray:**\n   - Minimize to system tray instead of closing\n   - Double-click tray icon to restore\n   - Window appears on current active monitor\n\n**For multi-monitor setups:**\n\n1. **Choose primary monitor:**\n   - Decide which monitor is \"home\" for app\n   - Keep window there most of the time\n   - Application remembers last position\n\n2. **Test before disconnecting:**\n   - Move window to monitor that stays connected\n   - Ensure title bar visible\n   - Close or minimize before disconnecting\n\n## Advanced: Manual Configuration File Edit\n\n**Only if other methods fail:**\n\n1. Close application completely\n2. Navigate to: `%APPDATA%\\ProjectorControl\\`\n3. Find settings file (e.g., `settings.db` or `window_positions.json`)\n4. Delete the file (or rename for backup)\n5. Restart application\n6. Window will appear at default position (centered)\n\n**⚠ Warning:** This may reset other window preferences.\n\n## Understanding Window Memory\n\nThe application saves:\n- Last window position (X, Y coordinates)\n- Last window size (Width, Height)\n- Last monitor (which screen it was on)\n- Maximized/minimized state\n\nWhen a saved monitor no longer exists:\n- Windows may place window off-screen\n- Application tries to restore to same position\n- But that position is now invalid\n\n## Testing After Fix\n\n**Verify window is working:**\n\n1. Move window to different positions\n2. Resize window\n3. Close and reopen\n4. Should reappear at last position\n\n**Test multi-monitor scenario:**\n\n1. Connect external monitor\n2. Move window to external monitor\n3. Disconnect external monitor\n4. Window should move to laptop screen automatically\n   - If not, use Reset Window Position\n\n## When to Contact IT\n\n- Reset Window Position button not available\n- Keyboard methods don't work\n- Window still invisible after reset\n- Problem persists across reinstalls\n- Multi-monitor behavior is broken\n\n## Related Windows Features\n\n**Windows built-in window management:**\n- `Windows+Shift+Left/Right` - Move window between monitors\n- `Windows+D` - Show desktop (minimize all)\n- `Alt+Tab` - Switch between windows\n- `Windows+Tab` - Task view (see all windows)\n\n> **Tip:** Use the keyboard method (Alt+Space, M) to move an off-screen window back to view. This works with any Windows application, not just this one.",
