  "content": "## Symptom\n\nConnection fails with error:\n- \"Authentication failed\"\n- \"Invalid password\"\n- \"Login denied\"\n- \"Credentials rejected\"\n\n**Key indicator:** Network connection is successful (ping works, port reachable), but projector rejects the password.\n\n## Diagnosis\n\nThis is a **password/authentication issue**, not a network problem.\n\n**Confirm diagnosis:**\n1. Run network test: Settings > Diagnostics > Run Network Test\n2. If DNS and Ping pass ✓ but PJLink fails ✗ → Authentication issue\n3. If all tests fail → Network issue, see \"Cannot Connect\" troubleshooting\n\n## Common Causes\n\n**Wrong password in application:**\n- Password entered incorrectly during setup\n- Typo in password field\n- Caps Lock was on when entering password\n\n**Password changed on projector:**\n- IT changed projector password\n- Security policy requires periodic password changes\n- Password reset to factory default\n\n**Entropy file missing:**\n- File `.projector_entropy` deleted or lost\n- Cannot decrypt stored password\n- Happens after Windows reinstall or moving to new computer\n\n**Projector authentication disabled:**\n- Projector configured to not require password\n- App trying to authenticate but shouldn't\n- OR projector configured to require password but app has none\n\n## Solutions\n\n**Step 1: Re-enter password**\n\n1. Open Settings (Ctrl+,)\n2. Connection tab\n3. Click **Edit** on the failing projector\n4. Find the **Password** field\n5. Clear current password\n6. Carefully type the correct password:\n   - Check Caps Lock is OFF\n   - Watch for typos\n   - Password is case-sensitive\n7. Click **Test Connection** to verify\n8. If test passes ✓ → Click **Save**\n\n**Step 2: Verify password with IT**\n\n1. Contact IT administrator or facilities\n2. Ask: \"What is the current PJLink password for [projector name]?\"\n3. They may need to:\n   - Check projector's physical menu\n   - Look up in documentation\n   - Reset password if unknown\n\n**Step 3: Check if password required**\n\nSome projectors don't require a password:\n\n1. Try leaving password field **empty**\n2. Click Test Connection\n3. If works → Projector has no password, leave field blank\n4. Click Save\n\n**Step 4: Check entropy file**\n\nIf you recently:\n- Reinstalled Windows\n- Moved to new computer\n- Restored from backup\n\nThe encryption key may be lost:\n\n1. Navigate to: `%APPDATA%\\ProjectorControl\\`\n2. Look for file: `.projector_entropy`\n3. If missing:\n   - Stored passwords cannot be decrypted\n   - Must re-enter ALL projector passwords\n   - Restore entropy file from backup if available\n\n## Understanding Projector Password Settings\n\n**PJLink password types:**\n\n**No password:**\n- Password field: Empty\n- Projector accepts any connection\n- Less secure but convenient\n- Common in small deployments\n\n**Simple password:**\n- 4-8 character password\n- Same password for all projectors (common)\n- Set in projector menu: Network > PJLink > Password\n\n**Complex password:**\n- 8+ character password\n- Different per projector (more secure)\n- Enterprise security policy\n\n## Testing Password Directly\n\nIf you want to test password without the app:\n\n**Using telnet (Windows):**\n```\n1. Open Command Prompt\n2. Type: telnet [projector-ip] 4352\n3. Press Enter\n4. If prompted, type password\n5. Type: %1POWR ?\n6. Should respond with power status\n```\n\nIf telnet works → Password is correct, problem in app\nIf telnet fails → Password is wrong\n\n## Preventing Future Issues\n\n1. **Document passwords:**\n   - Keep password list in secure location\n   - IT password manager\n   - Encrypted document\n\n2. **Backup entropy file:**\n   - Before Windows upgrades\n   - Before computer replacements\n   - Store in secure backup location\n   - Location: `%APPDATA%\\ProjectorControl\\.projector_entropy`\n\n3. **Use password manager:**\n   - Store in enterprise password manager\n   - IT can access when needed\n   - Automatic rotation supported\n\n4. **Coordinate with IT:**\n   - If IT changes projector passwords\n   - They should notify you\n   - Update app immediately\n\n## When to Contact IT\n\n- Don't know projector password\n- Password verification fails even with correct password\n- Entropy file missing and no backup\n- Need password reset on projector\n- Authentication worked before, suddenly fails\n\n> **Tip:** Test the connection immediately after entering the password (before clicking Save). This confirms the password is correct before saving it.",
