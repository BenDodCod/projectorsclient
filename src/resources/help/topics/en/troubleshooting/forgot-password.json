  "content": "## Critical Warning\n\n**There is NO password recovery option.**\n\nIf you forget your admin password, you cannot:\n- Open Settings\n- Change any configuration\n- Add/edit/remove projectors\n- Access security settings\n- Modify UI settings\n\nThe admin password is secured with industry-standard encryption and **cannot** be recovered or reset without reinstalling the application.\n\n## What This Means\n\n**You are locked out of:**\n- Settings dialog (Ctrl+, won't work)\n- Projector configuration\n- Connection settings\n- UI customization\n- All preference changes\n\n**You can still:**\n- Control existing configured projectors\n- Power on/off, change inputs\n- Use system tray quick actions\n- View history panel\n- Use the application for daily operations\n\n## Your Options\n\n### Option 1: Try Common Passwords (If You Might Remember)\n\n**Before giving up, try:**\n1. Your most common password\n2. Check if Caps Lock is ON (password is case-sensitive)\n3. Check if Num Lock affects your password\n4. Try password without special characters (maybe you misremembered)\n5. Try variations you commonly use\n\n**Do NOT:**\n- Try too many times randomly\n- There's no lockout, but wasting time won't help\n\n### Option 2: Restore from Backup (If Available)\n\n**If you have a backup:**\n\n1. Locate backup file:\n   - Default location: Where you saved backups\n   - File name: `projector_control_backup_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.enc`\n\n2. Close the application completely:\n   - Right-click system tray icon\n   - Select **Exit**\n\n3. Run backup restore (if you created a restore script):\n   - OR contact IT administrator for help\n\n4. Backup includes:\n   - Admin password (hashed)\n   - All projector configurations\n   - All settings\n   - History (if included in backup)\n\n**Limitations:**\n- Only works if you created backups\n- Restores to backup date (loses recent changes)\n- May need IT help to restore\n\n### Option 3: Reinstall (Last Resort)\n\n**If no backup and can't remember password:**\n\nYou must reinstall and reconfigure from scratch.\n\n**⚠ Warning:** This deletes ALL configuration:\n- Admin password\n- All projector configurations\n- All settings\n- All operation history\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Export current projector list** (if possible):\n   - You cannot access Settings, so this may not be possible\n   - Skip to step 2\n\n2. **Document current configuration:**\n   - Take screenshots of main window\n   - Note projector names, IP addresses (visible in status panel)\n   - Note any custom settings you remember\n\n3. **Close application:**\n   - Right-click system tray icon > Exit\n\n4. **Delete application data:**\n   - Open File Explorer\n   - Navigate to: `%APPDATA%\\ProjectorControl`\n   - Delete entire folder\n   - Also delete: `%APPDATA%\\ProjectorControl\\.projector_entropy`\n\n5. **Restart application:**\n   - Launch ProjectorControl.exe\n   - First-run wizard will start automatically\n\n6. **Reconfigure from scratch:**\n   - Set new admin password (WRITE IT DOWN THIS TIME!)\n   - Re-add all projectors using documented info\n   - Re-configure all settings\n\n## Prevention: Never Forget Again\n\n**After regaining access (or reinstalling):**\n\n1. **Write down password immediately:**\n   - Physical paper in secure location\n   - NOT on sticky note on monitor\n   - NOT in text file on desktop\n   - Secure location only you access\n\n2. **Use password manager:**\n   - Store in enterprise password manager\n   - LastPass, 1Password, KeePass, etc.\n   - Label clearly: \"Projector Control Admin Password\"\n\n3. **Create regular backups:**\n   - Settings > (future backup feature)\n   - Backup includes encrypted admin password\n   - Store backups securely\n   - Test restore procedure\n\n4. **Coordinate with IT:**\n   - If IT manages the application\n   - They may have password in secure vault\n   - Ask IT to document password\n\n5. **Choose memorable password:**\n   - Not \"password123\"\n   - But also not \"aK9$mZ2@pL5#qW8\" that you'll forget\n   - Balance security with memorability\n   - Passphrase often better than random characters\n\n## Why No Recovery Option?\n\n**Security design:**\n- Recovery options weaken security\n- Secret questions can be guessed\n- Password reset emails can be intercepted\n- This is a desktop app, not a web service\n\n**The admin password protects:**\n- Projector credentials (could control building-wide systems)\n- Network configuration (could expose IT infrastructure)\n- Security settings (encryption, backups)\n\nA strong security model requires no backdoor.\n\n## If You Must Reinstall\n\n**Make it easier next time:**\n\n1. Use consistent projector naming\n2. Document IP addresses\n3. Take screenshots of settings\n4. Create backup immediately after setup\n5. Test backup restore while you remember the password\n\n## When to Contact IT\n\n- Need help restoring from backup\n- Need projector IP addresses and passwords\n- Want IT to store admin password in enterprise vault\n- Need approval to delete and reinstall\n\n> **Prevention is the only cure.** Write down your admin password and store it securely! Consider using a password manager. There is no password recovery feature by design.",
