  "content": "## Symptom\n\nConnection is successful (Status Panel shows **\"Connected\"**), but specific commands fail with errors.\n\n**History Panel shows errors like:**\n- \"Command not supported\"\n- \"Invalid input\"\n- \"Feature not available\"\n- \"Operation failed: Incompatible\"\n\n## Diagnosis\n\nThis is a **compatibility issue**, not a network problem.\n\n**Key indicators:**\n- Connection test passes ✓\n- Some commands work (e.g., Power On)\n- Other commands fail (e.g., Volume Control)\n- Errors are consistent (same command always fails)\n\n## Common Causes\n\n**Incompatible projector model:**\n- Not all projectors support all PJLink commands\n- PJLink Class 1 vs. Class 2 differences\n- Manufacturer-specific limitations\n\n**Feature not enabled on projector:**\n- Projector has the feature, but it's disabled in menu\n- Network control disabled in projector settings\n- Requires physical menu access to enable\n\n**Firmware outdated:**\n- Old firmware with bugs\n- Missing features added in newer firmware\n- Compatibility improvements in updates\n\n**Wrong protocol/brand selected:**\n- App configured for wrong projector brand\n- Using manufacturer-specific protocol on generic projector\n- Incorrect PJLink class setting\n\n## Solutions\n\n**Step 1: Verify projector compatibility**\n1. Check projector model number\n2. Consult README.md compatibility list\n3. Verify PJLink class (Class 1 or Class 2)\n\n**Step 2: Try generic PJLink**\n1. Open Settings (Ctrl+,)\n2. Connection tab\n3. Click **Edit** on projector\n4. Change Brand to \"Other - PJLink Generic\"\n5. Click **Test Connection**\n6. If works, click **Save**\n\n**Step 3: Check projector settings**\n1. Access projector's physical menu (remote or buttons)\n2. Navigate to Network settings\n3. Verify:\n   - Network control: Enabled\n   - PJLink: Enabled\n   - Password matches app settings\n   - No IP restrictions\n\n**Step 4: Update projector firmware**\n1. Contact IT administrator\n2. Check manufacturer website for firmware updates\n3. Follow manufacturer's update procedure\n4. Test commands after update\n\n**Step 5: Disable unsupported features**\nIf command will never work (projector limitation):\n1. Settings > UI Buttons\n2. Uncheck the failing feature\n3. Hides button from interface\n4. Prevents user confusion\n\n## Understanding Error Messages\n\n**\"Command not supported\"**\n- Projector does not have this feature\n- OR projector has feature but PJLink command not implemented\n- Solution: Disable button in UI settings\n\n**\"Invalid input\" or \"Invalid parameter\"**\n- Projector doesn't recognize the input name\n- Example: Sending \"Component\" but projector calls it \"Video\"\n- Solution: Try editing projector config, use different input name\n\n**\"Feature not available\" or \"Feature disabled\"**\n- Projector has feature but it's turned off\n- Solution: Enable in projector menu\n\n**\"Authentication error\" (even with correct password)**\n- Projector requires authentication for specific command\n- OR projector's authentication is broken\n- Solution: Update firmware or report compatibility issue\n\n## Reporting Compatibility Issues\n\nIf you believe your projector should work but doesn't:\n\n1. Export diagnostic report: Settings > Diagnostics > Export Diagnostic Report\n2. Include:\n   - Exact projector model (check label on projector)\n   - Firmware version (from projector menu)\n   - Which commands fail\n   - Which commands work\n3. Contact IT or see FAQ for bug reporting\n\n> **Note:** Not all projector models support all features. This is normal and expected. Disable unsupported buttons in UI Settings to avoid confusion.",
