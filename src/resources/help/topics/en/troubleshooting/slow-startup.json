  "content": "## Symptom\n\nApplication takes more than 5 seconds to launch and display the main window.\n\n**Performance target:** <2 seconds startup time\n\n## Diagnosis\n\nMeasure actual startup time:\n1. Close application completely\n2. Use stopwatch or timer\n3. Double-click application icon\n4. Stop timer when main window appears\n5. Compare to 2-second target\n\n## Common Causes\n\n**Network connection delay:**\n- App tries to connect to all projectors on startup\n- Slow DNS resolution\n- Network timeout waiting for unreachable projectors\n- VPN overhead\n\n**Antivirus scanning:**\n- Antivirus scans executable on every launch\n- Real-time protection slows file loading\n- Especially common with older antivirus software\n\n**Database issues (SQLite mode):**\n- Database file fragmentation\n- Large database (thousands of history entries)\n- Database on slow disk (network drive, external USB)\n\n**System resource constraints:**\n- Low available RAM (<4GB free)\n- High CPU usage from other applications\n- Disk thrashing (100% disk usage)\n\n## Solutions\n\n**Quick fixes:**\n\n1. **Disable network check on startup:**\n   - Settings > Connection > Uncheck \"Connect to projectors on startup\"\n   - App starts instantly\n   - Manual connection when needed\n   - Recommended for laptop users\n\n2. **Exclude from antivirus scanning:**\n   - Contact IT administrator\n   - Add `ProjectorControl.exe` to antivirus exclusion list\n   - Significantly improves startup time\n   - Safe if application from trusted source\n\n3. **Use wired network:**\n   - Wi-Fi DNS lookups slower than Ethernet\n   - Reduces connection timeout delays\n   - More reliable generally\n\n**Advanced fixes:**\n\n1. **Compact database (if available):**\n   - Settings > Advanced > Maintenance > Compact Database\n   - Rebuilds database file\n   - Removes fragmentation\n   - Run monthly for best performance\n\n2. **Clear old history:**\n   - Settings > Diagnostics > Clear History Cache\n   - Removes thousands of old entries\n   - Reduces database size\n   - Faster queries\n\n3. **Move database to faster disk:**\n   - Only for Standalone (SQLite) mode\n   - Ensure database on local SSD, not network drive\n   - Database location: `%APPDATA%\\ProjectorControl\\`\n\n4. **Check system resources:**\n   - Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc)\n   - Check CPU, Memory, Disk usage\n   - Close unnecessary applications\n   - Restart computer if resources maxed out\n\n## Monitoring Startup Performance\n\n**Check application logs:**\n1. Settings > Advanced > Open Log Folder\n2. Open most recent log file\n3. Look for startup timing entries\n4. Identifies which component is slow\n\n**Typical log entries:**\n```\n[INFO] Application starting...\n[INFO] Database loaded in 0.15s\n[INFO] UI initialized in 0.32s\n[INFO] Connecting to projectors... (this may be slow)\n[INFO] Application ready in 1.85s\n```\n\nIf \"Connecting to projectors\" takes >2 seconds → Disable startup connection\n\n## Expected Startup Times\n\n**Ideal scenario:**\n- Modern computer (SSD, 8GB+ RAM)\n- No network check on startup\n- Small database (<1000 history entries)\n- **Result: 0.5-1.5 seconds**\n\n**Typical scenario:**\n- Standard computer\n- Network check enabled (1 projector)\n- Normal database size\n- **Result: 2-3 seconds**\n\n**Problem scenario:**\n- Network check with slow/unreachable projectors\n- Antivirus scanning every launch\n- Large/fragmented database\n- **Result: 5-10+ seconds**\n\n## When to Contact IT\n\n- Startup time >10 seconds after applying fixes\n- Antivirus exclusion needs approval\n- Database compaction not available\n- Network infrastructure issues suspected\n\n> **Tip:** For fastest startup, disable \"Connect to projectors on startup\" in Settings > Connection. The app will start instantly and connect when you click a button.",
