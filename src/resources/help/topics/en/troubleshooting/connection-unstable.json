  "content": "## Symptom\n\nStatus Panel frequently shows **\"Connection: Unstable\"** or connection drops intermittently.\n\n**Indicators:**\n- Status Panel alternates between Connected and Disconnected\n- Commands sometimes succeed, sometimes fail\n- History Panel shows pattern of timeouts\n- Inconsistent performance\n\n## Common Causes\n\n**Network Issues:**\n- Poor Wi-Fi signal strength\n- Network congestion (many users on same network)\n- Intermittent network hardware problems\n- VPN routing traffic unreliably\n\n**Firewall/Security:**\n- Firewall interfering with packets\n- Network security software blocking intermittently\n- Deep packet inspection causing delays\n\n**Projector Issues:**\n- Projector's network card issues\n- Overheating projector network module\n- Firmware bugs\n\n## Diagnostic Steps\n\n1. **Check Wi-Fi signal strength:**\n   - Look at Wi-Fi indicator on taskbar\n   - Move closer to access point\n   - Check for physical obstructions\n\n2. **Test with wired connection:**\n   - Connect computer via Ethernet cable\n   - If connection stable on wired → Wi-Fi is the problem\n\n3. **Run network test:**\n   - Settings > Diagnostics > Run Network Test\n   - Check ping times (should be <50ms)\n   - Look for packet loss\n\n4. **Monitor network quality:**\n   - Watch History Panel for patterns\n   - Note times when instability occurs (peak hours?)\n\n## Solutions\n\n**Immediate fixes:**\n\n1. **Switch to wired Ethernet** (most effective)\n   - Eliminates Wi-Fi issues entirely\n   - Stable, consistent performance\n   - Recommended for permanent installations\n\n2. **Increase timeout values:**\n   - Settings > Connection > Command Timeout → 15-20 seconds\n   - Gives connection more time to recover\n   - Reduces false timeout errors\n\n3. **Enable automatic reconnection:**\n   - Settings > Connection > Reliability > ☑ Enable automatic reconnection\n   - App automatically retries when connection drops\n   - Seamless recovery\n\n**Long-term fixes:**\n\n1. **Improve Wi-Fi infrastructure:**\n   - Contact IT to add access point closer to projector\n   - Use 5 GHz Wi-Fi instead of 2.4 GHz\n   - Reduce interference sources\n\n2. **Update projector firmware:**\n   - Contact IT administrator\n   - Firmware updates often fix network bugs\n\n3. **Investigate network hardware:**\n   - Check network switch ports\n   - Test different network cables\n   - Verify projector network settings\n\n## When to Escalate to IT\n\n- Instability persists on wired connection\n- Multiple projectors affected\n- Network tests show high latency (>100ms) or packet loss\n- Symptoms started after network changes\n\n> **Tip:** Prefer wired Ethernet over Wi-Fi for projector connections. Wi-Fi is convenient but often unreliable for real-time control.",
