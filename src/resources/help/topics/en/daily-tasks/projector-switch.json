  "content": "## Multiple Projector Support\n\nIf you have multiple projectors configured, you can switch between them to control different projectors from the same application window.\n\n## The Projector Selector\n\n**Location:**\n- Top toolbar, next to the Settings icon\n- Shows current projector name\n- Dropdown with all configured projectors\n\n**Visibility:**\n- Visible only when 2+ projectors are configured\n- Hidden automatically if only one projector exists\n\n## How to Switch Projectors\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Click the **Projector Selector** dropdown in the toolbar\n2. View the list of available projectors\n3. Each projector shows:\n   - Projector name\n   - Current connection status (Connected/Disconnected)\n   - Power state and input (if connected)\n4. Click the projector you want to control\n5. The interface updates immediately\n\n**What happens:**\n- Status Panel refreshes to show selected projector's state\n- Control buttons now affect the selected projector\n- History Panel continues showing combined history\n- System tray tooltip updates to show selected projector\n\n## Understanding Projector Status\n\nIn the dropdown, each projector shows its current state:\n\n**Connected, On (HDMI1)**\n- Projector is online and operational\n- Currently powered on\n- Active input is HDMI1\n\n**Connected, Off**\n- Projector is online but powered off\n- Ready to receive commands\n\n**Disconnected**\n- Cannot reach projector\n- May be offline, network issue, or incorrect configuration\n\n## Managing Multiple Projectors\n\n**Best practices:**\n- Name projectors clearly (e.g., \"Conference Room A\", \"Training Room B\")\n- Check connection status before switching\n- One projector can be controlled at a time\n- History shows operations for all projectors (not filtered)\n\n**When to use:**\n- Managing multiple conference rooms\n- Switching between classroom projectors\n- IT staff controlling building-wide projectors\n\n> **Note:** If you only have one projector configured, the selector dropdown is hidden automatically.",
