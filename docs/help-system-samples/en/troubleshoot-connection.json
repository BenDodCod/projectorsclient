  "content": "## Symptom\n\nYou see \"Connection: Failed\" in the Status Panel, or get errors like:\n- \"Cannot connect to projector at 192.168.1.100:4352\"\n- \"Connection timed out\"\n- \"Connection refused\"\n\n## Step-by-Step Diagnosis\n\n### Step 1: Verify Network Connectivity\n\nTest if your computer can reach the projector:\n\n1. Open Command Prompt (Win+R, type \"cmd\", press Enter)\n2. Type: `ping 192.168.1.100` (replace with your projector's IP)\n3. Press Enter\n\n**Results:**\n- ✓ **\"Reply from 192.168.1.100...\"** → Network is working, continue to Step 3\n- ✗ **\"Request timed out\"** → Network problem, continue to Step 2\n\n### Step 2: Check Network Connection\n\n- Is your computer connected to the network? (Check Wi-Fi or Ethernet icon)\n- Is the projector physically turned on?\n- Are you on the same network as the projector? (VPN can interfere)\n- Try disconnecting and reconnecting to the network\n\n### Step 3: Verify Projector IP Address\n\n- Confirm the IP address with your IT administrator\n- Check if the IP address changed (DHCP lease may have expired)\n- Access the projector's physical menu to verify network settings\n\n### Step 4: Check Firewall Rules\n\n- Windows Firewall may be blocking TCP port 4352 (PJLink)\n- Temporarily disable firewall to test (re-enable after!)\n- Contact IT to add a firewall exception for port 4352\n\n### Step 5: Test PJLink Protocol\n\n1. Open **Settings > Connection > Test Connection Now**\n2. Review the error message for specific failure details\n\n**Common errors:**\n- \"Connection refused\" → Projector not accepting connections, verify port number\n- \"Authentication failed\" → Wrong password, check Settings > Connection > Edit\n- \"Timeout\" → Network issue, return to Steps 1-4\n\n## Quick Fixes\n\n**Try these first:**\n- Restart the application\n- Turn the projector off and on (at the power switch, not remotely)\n- Increase timeout: Settings > Connection > Command Timeout to 15 seconds\n- Enable automatic reconnection: Settings > Connection > Reliability\n\n## Still Having Issues?\n\n1. Run **Settings > Diagnostics > Export Diagnostic Report**\n2. Contact your IT administrator with the diagnostic file\n3. See the FAQ for additional troubleshooting steps\n\n> **Common Cause:** VPN connections often route traffic through different networks. Try disconnecting from VPN if you're having connection issues.",
