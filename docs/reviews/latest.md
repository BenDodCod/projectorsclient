## Quick Context for Next Session

### What Was Accomplished
- **Completely rewrote README.md** - transformed from developer-focused to production-ready deployment guide
- Created 17-section structure optimized for end users and IT administrators
- Added professional badges (version, tests, coverage, platform, status)
- Organized features by persona (IT Admin, End User, Organization)
- Added comprehensive sections: Troubleshooting, Backup & Recovery, Security Considerations, Roadmap, Support
- Updated all metrics to latest values: v2.0.0-rc2, 1,564 tests, 94% coverage
- De-emphasized developer content (moved to bottom, still available)
- Verified all metrics against ROADMAP.md and BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md

### Current State
- **Working on:** Documentation for production pilot deployment
- **Branch:** `main`
- **Version:** 2.0.0-rc2
- **Tests:** 1,564 passing (94%+ coverage)
- **Database Schema:** v4 (protocol type normalization)
- **Blockers:** None
- **New Documentation:** ✅ Production-ready README (COMPLETE)

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Create User Guide with screenshots (`docs/user-guide/USER_GUIDE.md`)
2. Create IT Administrator Deployment Guide (`docs/deployment/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`)
3. Create FAQ document (`docs/FAQ.md`) based on UAT findings
4. Continue pilot deployment preparation

### Open Questions/Decisions
- Should we add actual screenshots to README hero section? (Would increase visual impact)
- Do we need separate Administrator Guide, or is README sufficient?
- Should v2.0.0 release notes be in README or separate CHANGELOG.md?
