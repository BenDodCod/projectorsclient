> **Branch:** `main`

## Summary

Completed Phase 6 (Production Build & Pilot Test) in full and updated the user guide for v2.1.0. Built and smoke-tested the production EXE (v2.1.0, 44.93 MB), assembled the deployment package, deployed to the correct network share (`\\fileserv\e$\Deployments\ProjectorControl`), created the pilot test checklist, posted Phase 6 results to the shared AGENT_DISCUSSION.md, and updated both the English and Hebrew user guides with the two new features (IT-managed deployment mode, auto-updates).

## Work Completed

### Tasks Done
- [x] Committed Phase 6 build artifacts (PILOT_TEST_CHECKLIST.md, build_manifest.json, smoke_test_report.txt)
- [x] Fixed deployment package network path — corrected from `Remote_Deployment` to `\\fileserv\e$\Deployments\ProjectorControl\Latest\` and `Versions\v2.1.0\`
- [x] Copied deployment package to network share (Latest + versioned archive)
- [x] Updated PILOT_TEST_CHECKLIST.md with corrected paths
- [x] Appended Phase 6 results to `\\fileserv\e$\Remote_Deployment\AGENT_DISCUSSION.md`
- [x] Updated USER_GUIDE.md to v1.1 with new IT-managed deployment mode and auto-updates sections
- [x] Mirrored all user guide changes in USER_GUIDE.he.md (Hebrew)

### Files Modified
- `docs/PILOT_TEST_CHECKLIST.md` — created, then corrected network share paths
- `build_manifest.json` — updated to v2.1.0 build metadata
- `smoke_test_report.txt` — updated to v2.1.0 smoke test results
- `docs/user-guide/USER_GUIDE.md` — v1.1: added Section 2.7 (IT-Managed), auto-updates section, read-only connection note
- `docs/user-guide/USER_GUIDE.he.md` — same updates in Hebrew

### Tests
- **New tests added:** 0 (this session was docs/deployment focused)
- **Total tests passing:** 65/65 (unchanged from Phase 5)
- **Coverage:** 94%+ (unchanged)

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Options Considered | Chosen | Rationale |
|----------|-------------------|--------|-----------|
| Deployment package location | `Remote_Deployment\deployment_package\` vs `Deployments\ProjectorControl\` | `Deployments\ProjectorControl\` | User corrected — this is the established share structure |
| Versioned archive | Flat `Latest\` only vs `Latest\` + `Versions\v2.1.0\` | Both | Keeps current version accessible while preserving rollback archive |
| User guide scope | English only vs both languages | Both | Keep EN and HE guides in sync as per project standards |

---

## Issues Encountered

### Issue 1: Deployment package path was wrong
- **Problem:** Initial PILOT_TEST_CHECKLIST.md and deployment referenced `\\fileserv\e$\Remote_Deployment\deployment_package\` — the wrong path
- **Resolution:** User corrected to `\\fileserv\e$\Deployments\ProjectorControl\`. Updated checklist, copied files to correct location with `Latest\` and `Versions\v2.1.0\` subdirs
- **Added to LESSONS_LEARNED:** No (one-off correction, not a recurring pattern)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Pilot deployment** — IT administrator runs the pilot using `PILOT_TEST_CHECKLIST.md` against a test workstation
2. **Review pilot results** — Check all 7 pass/fail criteria; address any failures
3. **Agent 2 coordination** — Agent 2 needs to verify deployment status shows "completed" in web system after pilot

### Deferred (Future)
- Formal UAT with 3-5 external users (post-pilot)
- v1.0 stable release (after UAT)

---

## Open Questions

- [ ] Has Agent 2 seen Phase 6 results in AGENT_DISCUSSION.md and confirmed web system is ready for pilot?
- [ ] Which workstation will be the pilot test target?

---

## Notes

- The `dist/` directory is in `.gitignore` so deployment package files are not committed — they live on the network share only. This is intentional.
- The old `ProjectorControl-setup.exe` in `Latest\` was left in place alongside the new files (not deleted) as IT may still need it for reference.

## Checklist Before Closing Session

- [x] Updated `docs/REVIEWS/latest.md` with summary
- [x] Added any lessons to `docs/LESSONS_LEARNED.md` (nothing new to add)
- [x] Committed all changes
- [x] Tests passing (65/65)
