# Session Review: 2026-02-15

> **Duration:** ~15 minutes
> **Focus Area:** Development environment setup and run instructions
> **Branch:** `main`

---

## Summary

User requested instructions on how to run the application without building. Identified import resolution issue with `src` module and provided three solutions: editable install (recommended), quick run scripts, and PYTHONPATH setup. Created helper scripts (`run.bat` and `run.ps1`) for convenient development workflow.

---

## Work Completed

### Tasks Done
- [x] Analyzed project structure to identify main entry point
- [x] Diagnosed ModuleNotFoundError for `src` module
- [x] Created `run.bat` helper script for Windows batch execution
- [x] Created `run.ps1` helper script for PowerShell execution
- [x] Documented three methods to run the app in development mode

### Files Modified
- `run.bat` - Created batch script to activate venv and run app
- `run.ps1` - Created PowerShell script to activate venv and run app

### Tests
- **New tests added:** 0
- **Total tests passing:** 1,564 (unchanged)
- **Coverage:** 94% (unchanged)

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Options Considered | Chosen | Rationale |
|----------|-------------------|--------|-----------|
| Run method recommendation | Manual PYTHONPATH, module run, editable install, scripts | Editable install + scripts | Editable install is cleanest for development (one-time setup), scripts provide convenience for quick testing |

---

## Issues Encountered

### Issue 1: ModuleNotFoundError when running `python src/main.py`
- **Problem:** Python couldn't resolve `from src.resources.translations import ...` because `src` wasn't in the Python path
- **Resolution:** Recommended `pip install -e .` to install package in editable mode, which adds proper path resolution. Also created convenience scripts as alternative
- **Added to LESSONS_LEARNED:** No (common Python development issue, well documented)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. User will test the editable install approach (`pip install -e .`)
2. Verify application launches successfully with all three methods
3. Continue with development work based on ROADMAP.md priorities

### Deferred (Future)
- Consider adding development setup instructions to README.md under "For Developers" section
- May want to add a "Quick Start for Developers" section to make onboarding easier

## Open Questions

- [x] How to run the app without building? - **Answered**
- [ ] Did the editable install work for the user? - **Pending user confirmation**

---

## Notes

- Project uses `pyproject.toml` for configuration (PEP 518/517 compliant)
- Entry points are configured: `projector-control` and `projector-control-gui`
- After editable install, user can run with simple `projector-control` command
- The `run.bat` and `run.ps1` scripts use direct Python execution as fallback

---

## Checklist Before Closing Session

- [x] Updated `docs/REVIEWS/latest.md` with summary
- [ ] Added any lessons to `docs/LESSONS_LEARNED.md` - Not needed (no significant lessons)
- [ ] Committed all changes - In progress
- [x] Tests passing - No tests affected
