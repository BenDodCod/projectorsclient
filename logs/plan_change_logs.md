# Plan Change Logs

- 2026-01-16 (Session 5 - END) - PHASE 2 COMPLETE. Implemented T-001.2 (Backup/Restore with encryption, MigrationManager, v1→v2 migration), T-002.2 (Connection Pool 818 lines, Circuit Breaker 658 lines, ResilientController 698 lines), T-003.1 partial (integration testing expansion). Tests: 643→876 (+233 new). Coverage: 86.21%→87.56% (+1.35%). Integration tests: 53→84 (+31 new). Files created: src/database/migrations/, src/network/connection_pool.py, src/network/circuit_breaker.py, src/controllers/resilient_controller.py, plus 7 new test files. All quality gates passed: 876 tests, 87.56% coverage, 0 security issues. Project 10+ days ahead of schedule. Next: Week 3-4 gate review OR Week 5-6 DevOps & UI.
- 2026-01-16 - Updated agent workflow in synced files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md): (1) Read ROADMAP.md first instead of IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, (2) Reference IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md only via line number references from ROADMAP.md, (3) Removed redundant "Engage relevant agents" line since project-orchestrator handles delegation. Added IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md Reference Index section to ROADMAP.md with complete line number mapping (6582 lines organized into 18 sections). Added inline line references to all week/phase/task entries in ROADMAP.md for Week 1-2, Week 3-4 (Phases 1-3), Week 5-6, and Week 7-8. This enables agents to navigate directly to relevant IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md sections without reading the entire 6000+ line file.
- 2026-01-11 (Session 2 - END) - Session completed successfully. Created ROADMAP.md (504 lines) as primary project reference and updated project-orchestrator workflow. Enhanced PJLink Class 2 support (resolved 2 skipped freeze tests). Tests: 536→538 (all passing, 0 skipped). Coverage: 84.52%→84.91% (+0.39%, gap to 85%: 0.09%). Files modified: mock_pjlink.py, test_core_projector_controller.py, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, ROADMAP.md. Commits: c40bfa6, d5fed4f, d940c71. Timeline: 8 days ahead of schedule. Ready for Week 3-4 Core Development.
- 2026-01-11 (Session 2) - Enhanced PJLink Class 2 support. Resolved 2 skipped tests (freeze_on/freeze_off). Updated Week 1-2 summary: 538 tests (all passing, 0 skipped), 84.91% coverage (+0.39%). Mock server now supports both %1 and %2 protocol prefixes. Coverage improvements: projector_controller.py +2.17%, pjlink_protocol.py +0.55%. Only 0.09% from 85% target.
- 2026-01-11 (Session 1) - Updated Preparation Phase Roadmap in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to mark Weeks 1-2 as COMPLETE. Delivered 536 tests (509 passing, 30 skipped), 84.52% coverage, all 12 critical+high security vulnerabilities fixed, 8 days ahead of schedule. Gate reviews: WEEK1_GATE_REVIEW.md (APPROVED), WEEK2_TEST_REPORT.md (APPROVED). Documentation: threat_model.md (1,756 lines), secure_coding_guidelines.md, pytest_guide.md. Next: Week 3-4 Core Development.
